# Developer Resoures
- A repository of resources that helped me grow as a developer and created to help others down a similar path.

## Background
Hello, my name is James Dinh, and I am currently a senior software engineer at Groundswell who is passionate about development, coding, search engine optimization, accessibility, UX & UI design, learning new technologies and the role of technology in education.

I am a dedicated individual who is passionate about learning and growing in every facet of my professional life. There have been two themes throughout my career, my willingness to lead and my drive to help others succeed. I believe that collaboration and compassion for one another can go a long way in any team. My experiences as a teacher and coach have shaped me into the person I am today, and has led me to my current passion, software development.

Technology has always been a driving force in my career and it has led me to LearningFuze, where I studied Full Stack Web Development which helped me grow in the industry of coding and programming. While enrolled at LearningFuze I was immersed in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NodeJs, React, PostgreSQL and a variety of other libraries and frameworks. Most importantly, I gained the skills necessary towards learning new languages and technologies that will help me continue to grow.

## Advice I have for Career Changers
- Embrace your past experiences and see where you can draw connections
- Use your past experiences and failures to tell a story
- How can you use your past struggles to fuel you?
- Work harder in every aspect of your developer life to close the gap. Some of us don't have computer science degrees, how can we out grind others? (Articles, Networking, build great relationships, volunteer your time, look at yourself in the mirror how can you improve)
- See how you can serve others, make sure you have no ulterior motives (Not every coffee meet-up should be about finding a job)
- Take an interest in others
- Listen to podcasts and understand many things at a high level
